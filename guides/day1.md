## Setting up a Virtual Environment
  
Check Python version and install or upgrade if less than 3.5.x.

Check Pip version and install or upgrade if less than 10.x.

* Mac/Linux - Option A: `sudo -H pip3 install --upgrade pip`
* Mac/Linux - Option B: `brew upgrade python`
* PC - `python -m pip install --upgrade pip`
    

Check Pipenv version and install or upgrade if less than 2018.x
<br>*(2018.10.13 as of November 6, 2018)*


Normally you'd make a repo with a README and a Python gitignore, but since we're
going to be using pull requests to turn things in, just fork this repo instead.
  

Clone repo on to local machine.
  
In the terminal, navigate to root folder of repo.

Create pipenv virtual environment:

```
pipenv --three
```

* The `--three` option tells it to use Python3
* This is similar to using `npm`/`yarn`
    

Verify that the `Pipfile` was created in the root of the repo.


Activate pipenv with `pipenv shell`

* You should see the command line change to the name of your repo/folder
  followed by a dash and a random string.
* We are using pipenv because it is newer and more robust. Uses a lockfile
  similar to npm/yarn. Easier to get into and out of shell.
* To get back in, use `pipenv shell` from the root directory of the project.
    
## To Start a Django Project and App

Once you are in the virtual environment, install django:

```
pipenv install django
```

* We are using a virtual environment instead of installing globally because
  installing globally would be like using npm/yarn install globally and
  installing all the packages on everything.
    
Add `Pipfile` and `Pipfile.lock` to the repo with `git add Pipfile*` and commit
with `git commit -m "added pipfiles"`.

Start a project with `django-admin startproject [name_of_project] .`

* Replace [nameofproject] with the name of your project
* The . tells it to create the project in the current directory. Otherwise, it
  would create a project in a subdirectory called [name_of_project]. We don’t
  need that because we want the repo folder to be the root
    
Verify that the [name_of_project] folder was created and has boilerplate files
such as `__init__.py`.

The project is what it was named above. A project is made up of a collection of
apps. It can have one or many.

  
Create an app with `django-admin startapp [name_of_app]`

* For the first project, we are naming the app notes
* Name it differently as appropriate if you are following this to set up, but
  working on something else.
    
## Start the Server

Verify that the [name_of_app] subdirectory has been created

Test by navigating to the project folder root/[name_of_project] and running
`./manage.py runserver`

* This should launch the animated rocket default page
* Take note of the warning about unapplied migrations. We will fix that in a moment
    
Django makes it easier to make changes to databases. This is called migration(s).


## Migrations

Run `./manage.py showmigrations`. This will show a list of outstanding
changes that need to occur.

To take a closer look at what is being done, you can look at the SQL queries
that Django is building. _This step is entirely optional, and is only for the
curious--which should be you!_

```
./manage.py sqlmigrate [package_name] [migration_id]
```

for example 

```
./manage.py sqlmigrate admin 0001_initial
```

* This will display a large number of sql commands that may not make sense if
  you are not yet familiar with SQL.
* This doesn’t actually do anything. It just displays info.
* These are all the data structures that your python code has created. Django
  turns this into sql tables, etc. for you. (If you’ve ever done this manually,
  you know how awesome that is :) )
    

To actually run the migrations, use:

```
./manage.py migrate
```

Check them by showing migrations again: `./manage.py showmigrations`

* The list of migrations should show an `x` for each item.

Run the server again and confirm that the migration warning is not present.
There won’t be a change to the actual page that renders.

## Adding Data Models

In the `notes` folder, open `models.py`.

Create a class called `notes` that inherits from `models.Model`:

```python
class Note(models.Model):
```

This gives our new class access to all of the built-in functionality in `models.Model`.

Think about the data that we need for standard web notes functionality. We might
want a title, body, some timestamps, etc. We can use the docs to find the types
of things we can add:

https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/ref/models/

Add the following variables to the class:

```python
class Note(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    content = models.TextField(blank=True)
```

Add any additional fields you would like as well. Check out the [Django docs](https://docs.djangoproject.com/es/2.1/ref/models/fields/) for more details on what fields the Model class makes available to us.

We also need something to serve as a unique identifier for each record. We’ll
use something called a UUID for this:
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier).

Add a UUID to serve as a key for each record.

* First, import the library:
  ```python
  from uuid import uuid4
  ```
* Second, add the field:
  ```python
  id = models.UUIDField(primary_key=True, default=uuid4, editable=False)
  ```
    
* Primary key is how the database tracks records.
* Default calls a function to randomly generate a unique identifier.
* We make editable false because we never want to change the key.
* Put it at the top of the list of fields because it’s sort of like the index
  for the record.
    
Next, we need to tell the project that the app exists. Open `settings.py` from
the project folder.

Find the section for `INSTALLED_APPS` and add `'notes'`, or other apps as
appropriate.

In the console, check for migrations again with `./manage.py
showmigrations`. The notes app should show up in the list now, but it has no
migrations.

To generate the migrations, run:

```
./manage.py makemigrations
```

If you get an error that there are no changes to make, double-check that you
have saved `models.py`.

Show migrations again to make sure they appear, then do the migration:
```
./manage.py migrate
```

## Adding Data with the Python Shell

`manage.py` has its own shell. Run `./manage.py shell` to bring up a Python repl.

* The input line should change to `>>>`

Import the notes class into the repl:
```python
from notes.models import Note
```

Create a new note with:
```python
n = Note(title="example", content="This is a test.")
```

Check by the name of your variable to make sure worked:
```python
n
```

We can use a built in function from models (which `Note` inherited from!) to
save this to the database:
```python
n.save()
```

Exit the terminal, then restart it - `exit()` then `./manage.py shell`

We have to import the `Note` class again, using the same command as before.

There is another built in method that will retrieve all existing objects of a
class: `Note.objects.all()`

Use this to save the data back into a variable named `b` and explore.

## Moving the Secret Key to `.env`  

Take a look at that secret key in `settings.py`.

We want to move this out of the settings file so that it doesn’t get checked
into source control. We’ll move it to another file, which everyone on the
project will need a copy of, but it won’t be in the repo itself.

We’re going to make use of a module called Python Decouple by installing it in
the virtual environment:
```
pipenv install python-decouple
```

Once it’s installed, we can bring it into `settings.py` with:
```python
from decouple import config
```

Pull up the docs for Python Decouple and take a look at the usage and rationale.
There is an example for how to use it with Django. Follow that to remove the key
from settings.

Add the key your `.env` file (creating it if you have to):
```
SECRET_KEY='...whatever it was in the settings file...'
```

Then change the line in `settings.py` to:
```python
SECRET_KEY = config('SECRET_KEY')
```

We should also move `DEBUG` to the config file. Because the file is a string,
and `DEBUG` expects a bool, we need to cast it:
```python
DEBUG = config('DEBUG', cast=bool)
```

We do this not for security, but so that it can be changed as needed on a
development machine, without modifying the source code.

Don’t forget to add it to `.env` as well.

Test to make sure it still works and debug as needed.
==>> would be nice if Lambda was kind enough to show us how to debug!!

Before moving on, verify that `.env` is in `.gitignore` and commit.

## Creating New Secret Keys

In case you've already committed a key earlier on accident, you can just
generate a new one in any Python REPL with:

```python
import random
''.join([random.SystemRandom().choice('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789!@#$%^&*(-_=+)') for i in range(50)]) # All one line!
```
